rackops is a tool for performing operations on rack operations.

It currently supports Netbox hosts and the Lenovo, Fujitsu, Dell providers.

To add a host or provider read [CONTRIBUTING.md](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Installation
============

1. Clone the repository.
2. `apt-get install python3-setuptools python3-requests python3-bs4
   python3-slimit python3-distutils`
3. On the root directory perform `python3 setup.py install`

Configuration
=============

rackops uses a JSON configuration file.
It defaults to `~/.rackopsrc`, but a different configuration file
can be used using the `-c` command line argument.

The configuration file should have this form:
```
{
    "host": <host>,
    "api_url": <api_url>,
    "username": <urername>,
    "password": <password>
}
```

where:
- `host` is the name of your host. Currently `host` can only be `"netbox"`.
- `api_url` is the URL of your host's API (i.e.
  https://netbox.noc.grnet.gr/api/dcim/devices/)
- `username` is the username that will be used while connecting to a provider,
  while
- `password` is the password that will be used

If environment variables for the above values are defined, they will overwrite
those from the configuration file. The environment variables supported are:

- `RACKOPS_USERNAME`
- `RACKOPS_PASSWORD`
- `RACKOPS_HOST`
- `RACKOPS_API_URL`

If command line arguments for the username and password are defined, they will overwrite
those from the configuration file and the environment variables.

Usage
=====

rackops can work as a CLI module or a python3 module.


CLI
---

`rackops <command> <identifier>`

The non-required command line arguments are:

- `-c`,`--config`. The location of the configuration file.
- `-u`, `--username`
- `-p`, `--password`. With this argument if the password is not provided as a string,
    the user will be prompted for entering a password.
- `-f`, `--force`. Some commands can be run with this argument. See `Commands`
  for more details.
- `-w`, `--wait`. Some commands can be run with this argument. See `Commands`
  for more details.
- `-v`, `--verbose`. Print logs.


As a module
-----------

1. `from rackops.rackops import Rackops`
2. `rackops = Rackops(command, identifier, config)`. `config` should be a hash
   table with the values defined in the *Configuration* section. If the command
   executed is intended to run with the `--force`, `--wait` or `--verbose` options,
   the `config` table should include the `force`, `wait` or `verbose` keys set
   to `True` respectively.
3. `rackops.run()`

Commands
--------

- `info`: Print information regarding the machine.
- `console`: Opens a Java console on the remote machine.
- `open`: Opens the IPMI host url on the client machine.
- `status`: Prints information regarding the status of the remote machine.
- `power-status`: Prints whether the machine is on/off.
- `power-on`: Powers on the machine.
- `power-off`: Sends a signal to the operating system for shutoff.
    Can be run with the `--force` command line argument for a hard shutoff.
    Can be run with the `--wait` argument to wait until the operating system
    shutoff is complete before exiting.
- `power-cycle`: Soft restart.
- `power-reset`: Hard restart.
- `boot-pxe`: Force pxe boot.
- `boot-local`: Force boot from default harddrive.
